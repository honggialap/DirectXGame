1.
- Working on SuperMarioBros3
- Stats balancing could be a pain in the ass if you not being careful,
like a simple gravity could trigger a effort wasting shit for 2 days.
Lucky me, i'm manage to fix the god damn bug before I decided to change the game scale back to x4.
- Like any other game design task, assets mapping is repetitive and boring, but a task is a task.
- I'm pleased with what I got so far, but I would have to speed thing up a bit.

2.
- Net code would have to wait still i'm done with 60% work load of SuperMarioBros3.
