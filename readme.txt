Update 22/01/22
- LAZYYYY ASSSS FFFFFFFFF
- Whole week and I did nothing but reading book, testing out tech, writing design docs and stories, but not coding...
- I should be coding if I want to be done with this.
- I think the first pattern I would have to implementing due to course requirement is Flyweight.
Still, I still want to finishing up the book before decide to change anything.
Apply patterns to the wrong problems gonna make a mess, not progress.
