Update 27/01/22
- I'm back, just went through an emotional break-down.
- Now I'm partialy done with NPCs of World 1-1, should I keep going to make other npcs or should I start to fill in items and props ?
- I'm still concerning about slopes, haven't done those before.
- Mapping and scene building take time, but not a major task, I've got tools to deal with those.
- Performance is good since I've made some improvements back in frameworks dev.
- So the main goal here is to get things done, so Imma go with completing World 1-1, and then Intro and World Map.
Instead of making all kind of stuff for the whole World 1 (which is 6 + 2 levels, and some other mini levels),
I just gonna done with what I know would be in requirements. I'm lazy, really, not that I don't love this game,
I've been making this for the 6th time now. I wanna put my time into other projects too.
