Update 20/01/22
- I'm running super late, because I'm feeling lazy recently. Back on track, i guess.
- I'm reading Game Programming Pattern, awesome book i would say. I end up never use Singleton in my code.
I could use Command Pattern for my "Actor", but not now.
If I end up upgrading my framework again, I would like to add Event System and Lua Scripting too.
But that is for after this task, now I would like to finish up the minimum requirement for Mario.
Who know what could be changed next semester, maybe it gonna be Castlevania, and my oh my, that suck.
